# Shortest Path Project

Within the scope of COMP 603 Advanced Algorithm Design, Shortest Path Algorithms implemented for given cities. Further information and screenshots of the program can be found on ShortestPathProjectResults.docx file.
Used Algorithms: 
```
-Bellman-Ford algorithm 
-Dijkstra's algorithm 
-Floyd-Warshall algorithm 
-Nearest-Neighbor 
-Hill Climbing 
-Best-First 
-A* Algorithm 
-Iterative Deepening
```
Those algorithms find the shortest path information of two cities with given connection information between cities. After finding shortest path this program will show the path on map. It also has a function that excludes a city from the map and new shortest path can be found around this city.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You have to install libraries below

```
-numpy
-gmplot
-googlemaps
-geopy
```

### Installing

You can install these libraries with using pip Ex:

```
pip install numpy
```
